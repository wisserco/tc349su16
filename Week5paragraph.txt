I much preferred full comps, especially for my project as it is so simple in being a personal website. 
The style tiles were so simplistic that I ended up doing two comps as the homepage does not hold much content.
In large projects the concept of style tiles seems very useful. 
Deciding an overall theme when a client is involved is much more important.
I spent about 10 minutes on style tiles and decided that full comps were the only option given the simplicity.
The full comps took about 50 minutes between deciding colors and actually mocking up the designs.
I think a simple and clean site that is navigation driven works best for my purpose.
My second comp is likely what my final site will resemble with content staying on the linked pages.
